## Overview

The project targets the development of an error
correction scheme for parity based codes using machine learning
approaches. We aim for a custom deep neural network, based on the Tanner
graph of the error correction code, using Min-Sum based algorithm in log
domain. The offline trained neural network will be implemented on a
ZedBoard platform.

## Setup

To install all the dependencies, simply run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

NOTE: After installation, Jupytext should also be available as an extension in
Jupyter Notebook (see File &rarr; Jupytext).
